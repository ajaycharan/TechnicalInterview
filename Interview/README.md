## Technical Interview

* There are seven important steps while approaching a problem during the interview:
* Clarifying the question: What exactly is the problem and what exactly is considered the solution.
* Confirm the inputs: What inputs does the function take and what outputs are required.
* Test cases: Explain several test cases that can be used for the algorithm.
* Brainstorming: Approach the problem and come up with a solution.
* Runtime complexity: Evaluate the runtime complexity of the algorithm and see if its good enough or not.
* Coding: Write the code and explain only the purpose of the code and not the whole text.
* Debugging: Run your code through the test cases and check its working.
* Be confident and answer to the point.
