## Introduction and efficiency

* Starts off with the requirements for the course, course contents and purpose of the course.
* The later half of the module discusses about the quantifying the efficiency of algorithms.
* This includes the Big O notation as an approximation.
* Some times interviewers might ask for the best, average or worst case time complexity. Some times these complexities can have different Big O time complexities.
* There could also be questions about space complexity. However, its quite rare.

### Practice Problems

* [practice.py](practice.py): Practice problem to test student's grasp on python syntax and OOP.
* [efficiency.py](efficiency.py): Example function implementations with different time complexities.
